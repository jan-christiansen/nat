nat
===

Implementation of natural and integral numbers by a binary
representation. All functions are supposed to be as non-strict as
possible. The package provides three modules `Data.Number.Int`,
`Data.Number.Nat`, and `Data.Number.Nat1` where the latter one
implements natural numbers without zero.
